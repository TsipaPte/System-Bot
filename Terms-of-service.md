## Responsibility

### Our responsibility

* We are responsible for the safety of our bot
* We are responsible for the privacy and security of users
* We are responsible for everything that is stipulated in the Discord API

Note: we can't fit all our responsibility about our bot as there is a lot of this responsibility, so we added 3 point if you need to see everything we are responsible for, then you can go to the [Developer Policy](discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-policy) and/or [Developer Terms of Use](discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-terms-of-service) - there you will find all the information

### Your responsibility

* You are responsible for your account being hacked by scammers

## Be careful

The authors and co-authors of the bot, as well as the bot itself, will never ask you for a login and / or password from your account, and they will also never ask for personal data not only for discord but also for life (for example: passport)
